# Introduction to R

## History and Overview

R is a dialect of S

S is a language that was developed by John Chambers and others at the old Bell Telephone Laboratories, originally part of AT&T Corp. S was [initiated in 1976](http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/doc/94.11.ps) as an internal statistical analysis environment—originally implemented as Fortran libraries. Early versions of the language did not even contain functions for statistical modeling. In 1993 Bell Labs gave StatSci (later Insightful Corp.) an exclusive license to develop and sell the S language. In 2004 Insightful purchased the S language from Lucent for \$2 million. In 2006, Alcatel purchased Lucent Technologies and is now called Alcatel-Lucent. Insightful sold its implementation of the S language under the product name S-PLUS and built a number of fancy features (GUIs, mostly) on top of it—hence the “PLUS”. In 2008 Insightful was acquired by TIBCO for \$25 million. As of this writing TIBCO is the current owner of the S language and is its exclusive developer.

The R language came to use quite a bit after S had been developed. One key limitation of the S language was that it was only available in a commericial package, S-PLUS. In 1991, R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland. In 1993 the first announcement of R was made to the public. In 2000 R version 1.0.0 was released to the public.
